#This Projects contains several projects based on football (or soccer) betting, approaching betting in a similar way to the stock market. From the begining of betting exchanges
betting (when the liquidity is high enough) immitates the stock market deeply, while also estimations can be made for the odds (or price) of an event to happen just like 
pricing a financial asset.

The Project in this folder contains the folowing subjects:

1) Market_Efficiency.ipynb : Here is tested the market efficiency theory in betting markets, by comparing average odds to closing odds.
   Average odds are the odds offered in the market quite vefore the start of an event, while closing odds are the odds at the momment of start of a football event.
   The closing odds should be more accurate since they include additional information from the market's participants. Also, in the majority of the cases there is no major
   information added in the odds by the market so the prices follow random steps similar to stock prices in the stock markets. Based on these ideas a betting "portfolio" is
   simulated in order to check the accuracy of the betting markets and how probable is to gain profit compare to number of bets (exchanges).

2) Modeling and strategies.ipynb : Statistical modeling for football games, testing popular betting strategies and trying to understand markets' pricing.

3) EURO_2024_SIM : Simulation of the European Championship 2024 based on the assumption that football games follow poisson distribution, given strength ratings for the
   participating teams.
