# Sports_Betting_Markets

The Project in this folder contains the folowing subjects:

1) Simple_Player_Props_model.ipynb : An example of creating a sports' model from scratch based on extended actions data throught logistic and linear regressions. The target of the project is to
   calculate the coefficients of a model for calculating the portion of expected goals of players compared to their team based on their position and their individual stats. The data used contain
   the top 5 european leagues (Premier lEague, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1) for the year 2017-2018.

3) Market_Efficiency.ipynb : Here is tested the market efficiency theory in betting markets, by comparing average odds to closing odds.
   Average odds are the odds offered in the market quite vefore the start of an event, while closing odds are the odds at the momment of start of a football event.
   The closing odds should be more accurate since they include additional information from the market's participants. Also, in the majority of the cases there is no major
   information added in the odds by the market so the prices follow random steps similar to stock prices in the stock markets. Based on these ideas a betting "portfolio" is
   simulated in order to check the accuracy of the betting markets and how probable is to gain profit compare to number of bets (exchanges).

4) Modeling and strategies.ipynb : Statistical modeling for football games, testing popular betting strategies and trying to understand markets' pricing.

5) EURO_2024_SIM : Simulation of the European Championship 2024 based on the assumption that football games follow poisson distribution, given strength ratings for the
   participating teams.
